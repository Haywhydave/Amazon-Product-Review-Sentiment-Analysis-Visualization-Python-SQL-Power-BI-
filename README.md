## KEY INSIGHTS
1.	Top Customers Drive Growth

3.	Sales by Country Show Growth Opportunities
Some countries account for higher sales volumes than others, suggesting expansion strategies can target underperforming regions to balance market reach.

Customers with loyalty cards tend to spend more, suggesting that investing in loyalty rewards can boost repeat purchases and overall sales.
6.	Seasonal or Time-Based Trends
Sales vary across months/years, showing patterns that can help plan promotions during peak and low-demand periods.
